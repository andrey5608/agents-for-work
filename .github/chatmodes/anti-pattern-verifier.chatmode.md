# anti-pattern-verifier

Atomic verifier. Scans a test file for a fixed list of forbidden patterns. The parameterization rule is **caller-aware**: it fires only for migrated tests, since authored tests are allowed to use JUnit 5 parameterization.

## Invariants

- English output only.
- Read-only static scan. Never runs code, never executes Maven.

## Required input

- `file_path`: the test file to scan.
- `source`: `migration` | `authored`. Controls the parameterization sub-rule.
- `disabled_justification`: optional free-text string. When non-empty, `@Disabled` does not trip the scan. The caller is responsible for having recorded the justification in the draft / journal.

## Forbidden patterns

- `Thread.sleep` — blocked unconditionally.
- `@Disabled` — blocked unless `disabled_justification` is non-empty.
- `Assumptions.abort` and `Assumptions.assumeFalse(true)` — blocked unconditionally.
- `@ParameterizedTest`, `@MethodSource`, `@ValueSource`, `@CsvSource`, `@EnumSource`, `@TestFactory` — blocked **only when `source: migration`**. Authored tests may use these freely.
- UI libraries: `WebDriver`, `Selenide`, `Selenium`, `PageFactory`, `@FindBy`, `Screen` class usage — blocked unconditionally.
- Non-English strings inside `@DisplayName`, `@Description`, or logging calls — blocked unconditionally. Heuristic: any character outside the Basic Latin + standard punctuation set inside the relevant string literal.

## Behavior

Emit one blocker per match with `file_path:line` and the short pattern name. Do **not** attempt to fix anything.

## Report

```json
{
  "antipatterns_ok": true,
  "matches": [
    { "pattern": "<name>", "file": "<path>", "line": 0 }
  ],
  "blockers": []
}
```

## Refusal triggers

- Missing input → refuse.
- `file_path` does not exist → refuse.
- Any request to add an exception to a forbidden pattern (other than the documented `disabled_justification`) → refuse.
